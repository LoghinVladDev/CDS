# customDataStructures

Name self explanatory\
Custom Data Structures for C++. Started as practice, ended up implementing several useful features\
Intended to provide support beyond what STL can offer

## Functionalities and support : 

### Data Structures :
* Concrete Generic Data Structures
  * Double Linked List
  * Single Linked List
  * Ordered, Unordered Sets
  * Hash Map
  * Unordered Map ( In Work )
  * Ordered Map ( In Work )
  * Dynamic Arrays
  * Static Arrays ( In Work )
  * Stack, Queue
* Abstract Generic Data Structures 
  * Object
  * Map
  * MultiMap ( In Work )
  * List
  * Set
  * Collection
  * BinaryTree ( Later Update )
* Particular Case Data Structures
  * B-Tree ( Partial Support )
* Utility 
  * Allocators
  * JSON - Parsing, Data Structure
  * Range
  * Tuple ( Partial Support )  
  * Random  
  * Sequence Iterable Objects
  * Parallel Sequence - Planned
  * Function
  * Threading
    * Thread
    * Semaphore
    * Mutex
  * Coroutines
    * Generator Functions  
  * Primitives
    * Pointer - Unique, Shared, Foreign
    * Reference
    * Optional
    * Pair
    * String
    * Object Encapsulators
